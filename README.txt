Press the arrow keys to look around.

Press the W, A, S, D keys to move.

Press SPACE to jump.

Press 'F' to toggle your flashlight on and off.

Press 'E' to interact with certain objects if an on-screen prompt appears.

The goal of the game is to collect three golden keys and escape out the front door of the haunted house.

Your fright meter (the red meter at the top of the screen) gradually increases, and if it
fills up completely, you lose. Standing near the fireplace, however, will decrease your fright meter,
so the fireplace is a good calm, happy place.

Your battery meter (the yellow meter below the fright meter) decreases while your flashlight is on.
If the battery meter runs out, your flashlight shuts off.
You can collect batteries around the house to refill your battery meter.
Without the flashlight, you may still rely on the low ambient light,
however your fright meter will increase more rapidly if the flashlight is off.


If you absolutely MUST cheat for some reason (i.e. gameplay is too hard),
press 'M' to empty your fright meter and fill your battery meter,
but only do this after admitting defeat.


Our two advanced topics are collision detection and shadows.
There is also some minor physics for player jumping.


Enjoy :D
